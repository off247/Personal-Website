    summary: 'During my time at Sportsdigita, I designed and built interactive presentation decks in the Digideck platform for major sports and corporate clients. I collaborated closely with sales teams and brand stakeholders, creating mockups in Illustrator and Adobe XD before building final decks in Digideck. Despite the platform\'s limitations, I developed creative workarounds with custom Illustrator elements to achieve polished, on-brand designs. By leveraging lindear storytelling and sequential animations, I made complex content easier for audiences to follow and more engaging to experience.',
